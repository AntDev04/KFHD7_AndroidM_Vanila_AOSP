# Now that thats out of the way, please enjoy my Pure-AOSP builds for the
# 2012 Kindle Fire HD 7" and my custom 2nd bootloader with extra features
# like Menu on startup and Charge Indicator for charging while off
# 
# 
# You may choose one or both of these as they should work with any rom
# built for the KFHD7(TATE ONLY NOT SOHO) but you have to build the 
# Uboot with a custom boot.img as it is embedded within the Boot.img
